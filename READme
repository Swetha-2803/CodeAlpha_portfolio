My Frontend Development Internship at CodeAlpha! 🎯

🌐 I’ve successfully built a Personal Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — a reflection of my skills, creativity, and journey as a budding web developer.

✨ Features include:
🔹 Animated background effects
🔹 Stylish skill badges & glowing buttons
🔹 Resume download option
🔹 Interactive contact section with social media & WhatsApp
🔹 Smooth transitions & responsive design

This portfolio represents who I am and what I can build.
I’m proud to mark this milestone in my learning journey with CodeAlpha! 💙
